# Linear reductor todo

Linear reductor is a program designed to help solve the time complexities of a certain kind of covering-packing problems with infinite label set in biregular trees. For now it tries to convert a problem into a normal LCL without any loss of generality, where other solutions can be again used.


### Improvements
- [x] Union of intervals when both are equivalent.
- [x] Union of intervals when one is strictly more suitable than the other.
- [ ] Disection of an interval when it cannot be discretized.
- [ ] Add test suite.
- [ ] Convert the notebook to a normal python program.



### Maybe in the future
- [ ] Rewrite the program, perhaps in a faster language.
