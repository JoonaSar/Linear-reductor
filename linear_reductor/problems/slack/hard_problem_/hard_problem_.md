# Hard problem 

## Problem setting
- $d, \delta = 3, \; 3$
- $\alpha=7/5$
- $\beta=8/5$
- $\Sigma=[0, 1/10) U (20/45, 21/45) U (30/45, 1]$
- Sigma is split at k/45 for each k in 1...44
- $\epsilon = 0.0001$

## Solution
Problem is not discretizable.








## Notes
This problem doesn't discretize in any split count 1-45 (with midpoint-heuristic).
