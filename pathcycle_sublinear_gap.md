### Claim: Sublinear time complexity implies $`log^*n`$ time complexity

Idea of proof: Let there be an algorithm A that solves some locally verifiable problem $`\Pi`$ with $`T(n) = o(n)`$ time complexity. The problem $`\Pi`$ may have up to uncountably infinite output label. Now let us try to implement the algorithm for a directed cycle of size $`N`$. Artificially narrow down the scope (lie to the algorithm) to a smaller **constant** $`n`$, such that $`T(n) \ll n`$. Now as $`n`$ is fixed, the algorithm runs in constant time. We still need to fix the unique identifiers, as the algorithm cannot use them as they are. Using k-anchoring, where $`k\approx n`$, create secondary non-unique identifiers, so that each fragment has ordered secondary identifiers $`1, 2, 3, ...`$ up to possibly $`2k`$. Now from the perspective of a single node there is no difference between the algorithm running on an actual graph of size $`n`$, and tricking the algorithm to run on the secondary identifiers with fixed scope $`T(n)=O(1)`$ in a graph of size N. Also, the set of labels that the algorithm **could** use within the scope $`T(n)`$ is finite, so we can "finitize" our problem to account only those possible labels without any changes.
